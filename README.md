1.0.0:
-A ton of modifications to the base theme, here's a few highlights
  +Added the ability to use cover images
  +Added disqus functionality to the theme
  +Added an author page (not very happy with the look, but it's ok for now.)
  +Added a nav bar with dropdown for social links (should work on mobile too)
  +Rewrote a lot of the general.js file to add some features to the header slide animation
  +Added related posts at the bottom of the single posts
  +Modified and wrote a lot of really shitty CSS (please don't lambaste me! I'm not a web designer!)
  
I've tested the theme on FF, Chrome, iOS Safari, and IE10/11. The theme completely breaks on IE9 and I'm sure some older versions of Chrome/FF/Safari too. I'm not even going to attempt to fix this, as it would take me way more time than it's worth to me.

As an aside, this is my first project and first commit on Github.  You'll have to pardon my extremely hacky (at best) attempt to get things to flow and work in CSS. I may have violated some rules along the way, so feel free to critique, fix and commit. I don't plan on spending a lot of time  supporting this project outside of my own use of the modified theme, but I'll try to fix issues as they're reported.
